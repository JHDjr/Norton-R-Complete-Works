Ode to a Cat
Silver cat against the sun, so lighted.
Halos gold enwrap your body brighted
Alert to all things curious you find,
Receiving all things sensual to mind.


With winter's grip your winter coat prevails
As soft and gray as winter clouds and sails
Fill with wind, move tiny feet, so silent. 
Small in size, in loyalty, a giant.


Can U not return the love that's given?
Pretending, all the while hunger driven.
Make banner and sound aloud your presence.
Ancient men sang praise, adored your essence.


Clad with nature's weapons always fearless.
Glow in form and function, ever peerless. 




Comments: This came from a momentary glance at Mr. Grey (my Korat cat) as he walked under a cypress tree, outlined by the sun, an hour after sun up. One look was all it took. 
________________
Verse of Time
Time and space swirl through my mind,
Like clouds of dust and misty rime.
With crystalline tops and heavy rain,
To occupy the lower parts of brain.


Can we not remove the blinds,
That manifest our acts in time.
Is life more like a runaway train,
Or pitiless, like a lover's refrain?


Let's adhere to notions kind.
And celebrate the truths we find.
Leave shadows back on memory lane
Increase within the spiritual plane. 


Comments:  Wrote this after completing the prose “Time”, or the other way around.












Triticale Days
The gathering of northern winter wheat,
Ensures that all will have enough to eat.
A hybrid hearty grows when others fail,
To feed the populace when sun grows pale.
The dust, the male parts of kind, from Ryes,
Will join Wheat's counterpart of least demise.
Seed once, graze twice, polyploidy enhanced.
The crop survives in winter, not by chance.
Triticeae is tribe to all these blends.
Man's mind applied and nature's force to bend.
Combine the Triticum with Secale,
Produce enough to leave a legacy.
In mem'ry alpha lives the wheat restored
For fodder, flour mix, this hay is lord. 
Comments:  This verse was inspired by Star Trek, "The Trouble with Tribbles". The wheat hybrid is grown in 14 countries, mostly Europe and North America. 
________________
Sonnet to an Organized Mind


My mind is but a filing cabinet.
Detaching when I lie my head to sleep.
Always thinking, not in dreams, heaven sent
Filing through the ether of thoughts I keep.


How deep the recessed mist can surface still,
To rob the brain, distracting finer grace.
Pensive globe, release the eye, restore will.
Allow the conscious parts to set the pace.


When mind surrenders to naivety,
Then judging others shocks the psyche’s core.
Desire's hold disclaims supremacy.
All cat and vanity can live no more.


The center of our being is unaware.
Of battles that took place from pain we bare.






________________


The Light of The Phoenix


When the morning sun is on the rise.
The birds that pass its light,
Assume an iridescent glow,
Illuminating sight


When wings are spread in awesome flight,
The shadows start to move.
The edges of their wings alight.
Like golden tears that sooth.


Just like a burning Phoenix  tried
To lift instead of fall.
The remnant of its former pride,
Are ashes to us all.




Comments:  Its funny that explaining verse often takes longer than the verseitself. Funnier, the way subconscious episodes occur while writing.
The line U liked doubles as an introduction to the 3rd stanza by
alluding to Phoenix mythology. The tears of the Phoenix have healing
powers and transmute all poisons (see, Harry Potter, Chamber of
Secrets for current ref.). The line, at first, was meant to describe
what beads of light around feathers looked like and how it made me
feel. It is much more now. The same thing  occurred with the last line. In mythology, the Phoenix lives, dies, and is resurrected from its own ashes, or its remnant. It falls, dies, then arises again  All beauty and grace of its former life, its "pride", or "glory" are now just the ashes of Time. I relate this to the human experience over Time. The remnants of our former "pride", yourself, are locked in memory and turn to dust (ashes), but are no longer real anyhow. Memory may be the least reliable of all our gifts. It is the hope of resurrection that steers the path of many. The Phoenix is appealing because resurrection is guarantied, but it may not come back as the same bird, and we would hopefully come back different; improved maybe.

Cows
                                                                                                            
I think that I knew not till now.   
The great annoyance of the Cow.
Whose ever chewing mouth is prest,
Against the puked up grass he messed.
From forth its udders, milk is drawn,
Containing proteins, make us yawn. 
A Cow that looks at God all day,
And lifts his ugly head to bray.
A Cow whose backside flies have lain,
That can't be cleaned with driving rain.
Upon their backs, so thick with hide,
Young cowboys! Can't resist a ride.
A cow who may in summer wear,
A lousy stench throughout its hair.
Its many chambered stomach filled,
With vinegar, drained when they're killed. 
Words are used by fools like me.
They can't describe Cows when they pee.                                       




Comments:  This came from Joyce Kilmer’s, “Trees”. A famous poem around WWI, even put to music.  It’s sort of a literary cover for practice which always helps.
________________
Our Country's Liberty


Let us walk through the fields of history together.
Past the groves of fallen fruit that nourish new dust.
We will run through those lawns of late oblivion,
To the garden of consciousness, and back again.
If only to pursue illusory blossoms,
That curse forever, the fragrance of flowers spent.




Comments:  This verse was originally attached to a prose piece, “Not the Only Civil War. I wrote it because writing about war filled me with compassion for all the fallen soldiers wasted by the failure of leadership only to become victims of human cruelty.
________________
A Docent's Tale
When Winter's seen
Things do get lean
For all the tiny Hummers


His thought that strayed
"I should have stayed,
In Mexico, what bummer".


“But with bullets flying round,
I would end up on the ground.
And I would not live to see another Summer."


So, remain here he must
To convert the protein dust.
Of insects all, so small, they made him fast.



"To a garden I shall go,
Where they have a flower show."
"That I might feast on nectar I may pass"


To a garden show he went,
But soft, his beak was rent.
The flowers at the show were painted glass
"How ever shall this mend,.
For my tongue I can not bend"
"Oh, fate can I endure what thou did send?"


A docent who was near.
Heard the Hummer's cry of fear.
Compassion moved her eye to shed a tear.


To straighten out the rend
Was the help that she could lend,
For love of nature, one can not pretend.


So, the Hummer flew away,
For to sip another day.
Of flowers that arrive with sign of Springs.


So, when you hear a bell,
Think of Hummer's Ode to tell.
And know an Angel docent earned her wings.


Comments:  I volunteer as a docent naturalist for Placerita Canyon Nature Center in Canyon Country north of L.A. City.  A most dedicated group of terrific people which I am very happy to be a part of.  A lot of knowledge for the asking.  All the stuff for becoming a Natural Philosopher begins there. 
________________
Connections
Like a reptile I awaken with the morning sun.
Like an insect this body needs warmth,
So I remain still in the sun.


Like an egg I can not hatch new life without heat.
Like an ape I sit in my random garden and eat.
Let Time have its winning blow. 


Like a flower whose petals share numbers with the cosmos,
I will share them too and become complete 
By more closely joining the whole.


 
________________


My Blue


Catalina blue, my favorite won!
Adorns facades of splendid Avalon 
Nearly royal, changes moods in the sun.
Seen through the glass of bottom boats that run.  


This color found in Island's clay is rare,
Found on the breasts of painted buntings fair.
Found in the sky when storm clouds can be seen.
Called  indigo in places I have been.


My blue from clay used up for heated tile.
It makes me think of all things blue and smile.
Sapphire Showers to Blue and Whisp'ring bells.
Depression glass, blue crabs, and broken shells.


Like glacial ice reflecting spectral blue.
The same reflections from the eyes of You
                                      
                                        


________________


1938 and Now


Wealth and happiness that counts
Are free to all in large amounts,
No matter what your life has lotted,
Make sure that all your herbs are potted.


There's millions worth of golden sunbeams
That everybody can possess
All God’s children got success
Come and get your happiness


There's billions worth of silver moonbeams
Enough for everyone I guess
What's a million more or less
Come and get your happiness


So get under that blue heaven.
Free from trouble and distress.
Just find Mother Nature's address,
Come and get your happiness.


Comments:  This is a song from the 30’s written to cheer people who really needed a lift. I reworked the verse, but not much. I knew it was needed in these times, as well.
________________
The Bells of Rime
What will you give me?
Save the Silver Bells a riming
Is there hope for the future?
If the ice filled winds die before you


What can we do, but freeze.
Toll the Blue Bells of Autumn's knell.
I hear, only the ringing breeze,
From the White Bells of a blind Hell


Oh, what will become of me?
Ring the Green Bells sounding falsely.
All would be well, if I's could see.
Say the sad bells of eternity


Oh, What can you do for me?
Cry the snow filled bells, now silent.
The end can not come, but once.
Say the Black Bells of soul’s content.


Comments: Sung to Nature from a narcissistic bend to the tune "The Bells of Rhymney" by the Byrds. It’s about a guy who gets stuck on Mt. Washington, NH (on a bad day) and what might be going on in his head.(tough one!)
________________
Dark Skies  (Astronomy)




City of Angels can not see celestial forms at night.
Angel City's veiled, softly, in its ambient light.
I long for darker skies above bucolic Vineyard Isles.
Where breezes push the clouds away and open Space for miles.


To witness Jovian children sleeping in their quiet display,
Or count the icy rings of Saturn's sparkling array.
Viewed countless jewels of timelessness in clarity bereft,
Of bright extraneous photons, obscuring visions cleft.


Oh gaseous clouds of ancient star, expanding dust revealed.
I see your light of ages, primordial secrets ever sealed.
Return me to a time when cosmic matter coalesced,
To witness birth of suns in burning elemental stress.


There was a time, not long ago, when dark skies did prevail.
A time of real darkness wherein ships were steered by sail.
An age when stars created myths and legends also born,
To hedge the fears of living, existentially forlorn.




St. Elmo's floating Fire alites, Aurora Australis,
Baal's lightning travels on the waves, suspended ambergris.
Creation's source is universal, radiant energy.
The same that fuels the stars whose remnant light we chance to see.


What spans the endless distances to fall on naked eyes?
The uncreated light that's only seen in darkest skies. 
________________


The Clairvoyant 




Within an onion domed church, near Golden Gate,
A glory filled reliquary (divine) was placed.
Here lies a shoeless man, of balded pate
Who suffered with our struggles, spiritually faced.




He granted me dreams of venerable processions,
Of Russians and Greeks in gathered mourning sessions.
What was viewed in the church missing walls proffered awe.
For the mystery that burned to my brain what I saw.




In mystical altar, flesh pulled, black en dried,
Transfiguring to life (back in time) when a priest.
Aurora's first rays struck my eyes and I cried.
For the hearing of father serve Liturgy’s feast.




Vladika paused, as if thoughts needed breath,
And spoke of all knowledge and faith we could trace.
From the martyrs of old that had realized death,
Till the first Bishop Peter, bestowed transient Grace.


Of Bolshevik upheavals and organized Red force.
The crushing of the Russian faith, from virtue’s altered course.
Rescued children starved in Shanghai with manna that he found.
He raised the Church near Golden Gate with love and honor bound.




I never met this Blessed John before his final sleep.
I have a Saint’s clairvoyant dream of faithful tears to keep.

Geology in Mind




No subject can reveal its secrets fine,
Like rocks exposed to nature’s wearing clime.
Rendering clues of Earth’s conditions in the past.
And things that might occur in future’s last. 


Pick and shovel, brushes, maps and drive,
Help Geo-rock enthusiasts survive.
All puzzle parts at first remain obscured,
Much water’s spilt discovering what occurred. 


In common gneiss and schists of foliated layers,
The Metasedimentary are two important players.
Of igneous and lava, mica flakes and fancy stones.
They add to Earth’s internal mass and change Volcanic cones.


I like to ride Sierra trails and study roadcut signs.
And try to put together patterns from the geo clines.
I look for clues revealing things that happened in a place.
Deep chasms and striations; shale’s cleft can leave a trace.


The golden dreams in mountains high flowed down with melting snow.
Exited Man’s base energies, and made his being low.
Reshaping nature’s glorious scape with pressured water’s bite.
Majestic hills, alluvial plains for all removed from site.


The genesis of gold is like Man’s penetrating greed.
A necessary sulphur adding color to his creed.
The quartz and pressure needed are like sharp rapacious acts.
A fever’s heat spreads burning fluid thru weakened mental cracks.


If ever I am swallowed up by earthquakes shifting maw.
I pray my grave lies high above Man’s err descending fall.

Chemistry in Kind


Oxidation and combustion can explain much in their time.
One is rust that never sleeps upon the iron bed it lies.
The other is the fire that excites the compound's heart.
There’s more to know then can be known, but we have made a start.


They call this one the Central Science, one reason, life’s concern,
With protein molecules that can determine infant’s name.
Osmotic flow of sodium ions across potassium plains.
Allow our muscles to contract, produces acid pain.


Its link to other sciences is clear as liquid air.
Though often the organic fumes are not so very fair.
Wish for a safer discipline where matter stays the same.
Soon you’re back exploding hydrogen and making potion’s flame.


Observation is essential to stem responses fine.
Reaction rate spontaneous, elementary particle sign.
The position of electrons to form covalent ties.
Always joining and then breaking up, a lot like humankind


The effect of radiation on atoms found in Space.
Awaiting dipole moments for radio signal trace.
Astrochemists catch emitting light on prism's eye it fell.
Dividing spectral lines that correspond to atom’s tell.


Absorption of particular waves reveal atomic clues.
The compounds made, the vapors fade, explosive residues.
The Alchemist of old who saw would not believe the dare.
Electrons shared, their valence paired for balancing the fare.


Plum pudding models, element charts arranged for substance pure
Synthetic drugs, researching years to isolate the cure.
I love to work in labs equipped with test tubes Bunsen burned.
And try to find a “something new” to add to what I’ve learned.


I praise my noble elements, even though they are but few.
Similarity in properties, invisible to You.

Botany in Rhyme


Many millions of years ago the plant learned how to seed.
The angiosperms were born aloft to solve replacement needs.
The pinnacle of evolution, Orchid’s blessed flower.
Its span so brief, its life complete when flower parts entwined.


In sunlight, earth, and water are the varied tools of trade,
Then rearrange the molecules adapting to the change.
Ability to make one’s food with photons in parade.
The parts absorb desired waves reflect a spectral range.


The problem is the insect that takes more than it can give.
They burrow and digest the green leave roots that cannot live.
When pressure’s felt the plant reacts releasing pheromones.
The poisons that a plant can make might chill your very bones.


Reserving night for gas exchange stomata opened wide.
The openings are mostly placed along leaf’s underside.
First separating hydrogen from water’s needy care.
Releasing what we need refreshing atmosphere with air.


Apomixis is an alternate to pollination rich.
It shrinks the wealth of gene pools, but quickly steals the niche.                                
Think of Pondo, La Gomera Laurels, Beech trees in Japan.
All are clonal in community from a single male they stand.
They represent a  biomass no greater on the globe.
Imagine! Progeny, from suckers, diploid seeds, or bulb.


My interest in this subject stems from gardens viewed with beds,
Of endless tulips, heather too and prickly poppy reds.
I adore the English roses more fragrant when their teas.
I love the desert wildflower in its singularity.


All science can excite the mind, but few command the eyes,
Like flower color’s power to take my breath from where it lies.






















Comments:  This poem may be enjoyed by 'inside-out esoterics’ or might appear as nonsense to those who are ‘outside in’.




Embrace Yourself


Evil thoughts may come to mind and fears,
That stay throughout your time.
When stressful notions grip your being.
And vision can’t be trusted seeing.
The pain that binds our twisted gut. 
Afraid, the challenged Mind is shut.
To virtues plain and wonders new,
That excite the hearts of thinkers few.
To look beyond the essential pain, 
Embrace the existential rain.
If doubts prevail then purge the thought.
Use Mind, and Will, and Soul that lasts.
And all things that were taught in past.
And memorized struggles that were fought
In time, since past, that brought us here,
To bravely face our darkest fears.

Physics Sublime




On Baldy Mountain’s summit bare,
They aimed a beam at Wilson’s glass.
The speed of light was measured fair.
Determined when it made its pass.


When amplifying beams of light,
To modify the shape of sight.
We use an isotopic lure,
To rectify and find a cure.


With matter constantly in motion,
How can energy be saved?
Subsonic sound moves through the oceans.
Whales speak below the waves.


Movement fast through cosmos past,
Can shift electron levels shell.
Absorbs the shining gamma last
And alters subatomic tell.


When Nature slides beneath the lens,
Exposing life’s most secret clues.
Results cause damage hard to mend.
Conclusions make the evening news.


Keeping wormhole travel far at bay,
In zero grav bones start decay.
Schumann’s resonance can bar the way. 
The sights and sounds receive delay.


The moon lies within a flower,
Of clouds unmoved by their own power.
Depending on the Coriolis way.


The airs from colder sites race down 
Sierra heights, all increasing
When it drinks the desert heat.


By the time the winds reach cities,
Santa Ana’s not so pretty.
Blowing hard, but not too trying to defeat.


Laws of Physics and of Motions,
With theory tested for its mark.
Help to scrub the mind of notions.
If finding proof is in the dark.


Physics sits upon the tower.
One mind raised to higher power.


Trying hard to render ethos as it must.
Science gathers secret evils,
Like rapacious cotton weevils
And falsely use the Knowledge placed in trust.
